      1. Finish implementing the click feature in the gallery.
      2. Implement the interests page.
      3. move the buttons to the header at the top of the screen to make navigation easier.
      4. Add more images and projects as I finish up the website's functionality.
      5. Optimize page for all screen sizes.
      6. Further experiment with css in order to make the page more dynamic and interesting.

              <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>Hello! my name is Lisandro Mayancela and I am currently pursing a Bachelor of Science in 
                Computer Science as well as a minor in East Asian Studies and Education Studies.
                My interest in Computer Science actually began at a young age when I fell in love with gaming and
                wanted to help make games so that I can bring these experiences to the next generation of kids.
                As I advanced through high school and learned more about CS, my goals shifted to wanting to work on
                Web/App development. In college, this would once again evolve as I now have a passion for eventually
                bringing my skills into education so that I can help foster the next generation of PoC students in tech
                so that the field can be diversified and all students can have an equal opportunity to get involved in CS.</p>

                  <p>During my sophomore year of high school I was a part of planning our school's first hackathon, InspiredxSTEM.
                    I assisted with advertising the event and build a simple webpage that gives visitors an introduction of
                    what the event is as well as a link to RSVP for the event. During the event itself I served as a mentor
                    to students ranging from middle school to early high school as they were working on their projects.</p>

                  <p>During the summer of 2017 I was given the opportunity to be a paid intern at Animoto, a cloud-based video creation service.
                    throughout my time at this company I was able to not only gain a significant number of meaningful connections in the
                    web development field, I also gained experience in working on large scale projects through git as well as writing tests and
                    completing a redesign of the video editor (which many of its features are still live on the site).</p>
